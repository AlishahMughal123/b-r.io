Hey there, if you're new here, welcome to the blog. After working as a developer for nearly 5 years now, I've learned how important it is to have the right sets of tools to get your job done.

In this reading I'll be sharing 9 essential applications that boost my productivity as a SWE and how I use them. But even if you're not a developer or developer student I'm sure you can quickly pick up on some new and unique apps to improve your own workflows.

On a side note noticed that AI is definitely a hot topic in among many of these. What do you think? Are you bullish on AI?

Lastly, this will be an ordered list from most generic productivity tools to more specific developer tools. So let's get started!

## Raycast

Let's dive into it, and I'll start with a super essential app called Raycast. Raycast was actually recommended to my by my channels by several people down in [my channel's](https://youtube.com/@brianruizy) comments, and I've been using it non-stop since installing it.

**Raycast is like a command center for your computer**, similar to Spotlight on Mac. However, it takes what Spotlight does and significantly enhances it. One notable improvement is the indexing speed.

The key thing for me with Raycast is context switching. While I'm doing focused coding work, I can quickly run commands, search for files, or ask Raycast AI questions without wasting time switching through different applications.

In addition to accessing your apps, Raycast offers a wide range of useful commands. It even has a sleek calculator that can perform conversions using natural language.

One feature I frequently use is window management because the default options on Mac are quite basic. Raycast provides numerous commands, and you can create hotkey shortcuts for the ones you use most. Personally, I have set up shortcuts to quickly split my desktop between windows like my text editor and browser.

I appreciate Raycast's design because it doesn't shy away from including more advanced features like scripts and hotkeys.
Another noteworthy feature is Raycast AI, which is a pro feature but well worth it in my opinion. As a developer, I often encounter situations where I need information or guidance on building a particular feature or using a new language. Raycast AI, with its integration of GPT prompts, allows me to find solutions much faster than traditional methods.

Sure, I could just open ChatGPT, but the time-saving aspect of Raycast, along with its context-switching capabilities, is a major plus.

Lastly, the extensive extensions store is a highlight of Raycast. There are numerous useful extensions created by other users, including a Lorem ipsum generator, Apple Music controls, and a color picker.

## Notion

Next up we have Notion, which I've always advocated for as a great tool just to have in your arsenal. Notion is a note-taking app that allows you to create pages and organize them into different categories. It's a great tool for organizing your thoughts and keeping track of your tasks.

But it goes beyond note-taking, the most powerful feature with notion IMO is the ability to create databases. This allows you to create a database of anything you want, and then you can switch between different views of your database to things like Kanban, calendar, list, and more.

## Warp.dev

Next up is Warp, an app aimed primarily at developers, taking the base Mac terminal to a whole new level. While the default apps may suffice, their functionality can feel lackluster, especially for those who enjoy tinkering and customization.

Warp Dev offers a command prompt and keyboard shortcuts that enable developers to work much more efficiently. One standout feature is the design approach to submitted commands. Lengthy console commands, such as running a server, can be easily forgotten. Warp addresses this by providing sticky headers that allow for quick reference without the need to scroll back up.

Additionally, Warp builds on top of tools like p10k or Oh My Zsh, offering features like autocompletion and Go support. These enhancements were previously separate installations for me, so having them integrated with Warp is a major convenience.

On top of all this, Warp AI is available for free with a refreshing limit, providing added value to developers.

Give Warp a try and experience a more powerful and efficient terminal. It's an invaluable tool for developers looking to enhance their workflow.

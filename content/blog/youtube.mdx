First let me provide you some background on my [YouTube channel](https:/youtube.com/@brianruizy). I uploaded my very first video on November of 2022. What was a simple video that I made for fun, turned into a passion and can even be considered a business. Over the year I experimented with different types of content, and eventually was able to recognize what my audience enjoyed the most.

Some wins and some losses, but in the end a sense of accomplishment. Now I'm confident enought to say that **anyone can start and grow and create a brand or business on YouTube**, by having the right systems in place. Even I was able to and I have been told that I'm shy and introverted. Here are some of the strategies and lessons I learned along the way.

## Find your unfair advantage

>The creator economy is empowering individuals to monetize their skills, passion, and knowledge in ways that were unimaginable before. It's a revolution of opportunity.

When I first started my YouTube channel, I was overwhelmed by the idea of finding a niche. I spent a lot of time trying to figure out what type of content I should create, and what niche I should focus on. However, I soon realized that instead of trying to find a niche, I should focus on finding my unfair advantage.

I started to think about what unique skills, knowledge, or experiences I had that could set me apart from other creators. As a sotware engineer who was always interested in photography and videos, I realized that I had a unique perspective to offer. I decided to create content that combined my technical expertise with my passion.

Questions to ask yourself ...

- what are you knowledgeable about?
- what are you passionate about?
- can you entertain, educate, or inspire people in a unique way?
- what unique skills or experiences can you share?

## Strategies for Rapid Growth

Discuss the specific strategies and techniques you used to grow your YouTube channel quickly.
Include tips on content creation, promotion, engagement with viewers, and collaboration with other creators. Some things I did that I believed helped me grow quickly

<Alert>Note that this is no science, and what has worked for me may not be universal. But I hope that you can take some of these strategies and apply them to your own content creation.</Alert>

### 1. Steal like an artist (ideas)

I spent a lot of time watching other creators and learning from them. I would take note of what worked and what didn't, and then try to apply those lessons to my own content. Inspiration is everywhere, and I found that by paying attention to what other creators were doing, I was able to improve my own content.

### 2. Title and Thumbnail

After getting inspiration and setting on an video idea, I would spend a lot of time on the title and thumbnail. I learned that the title and thumbnail are the first things people see, and if they aren't compelling, people won't click on your video.

### 3. Write it down (Scripting)

At the core of every video I made was a script. I would write down what I wanted to say, and then record myself saying it. This helped me to stay focused and on track, and also made the editing process much easier. I like to use [Notion](https://ntn.so/BrianRuiz2 ) to write my scripts and keep track of my ideas.

### 4. Get Creative / Retention

You've probably heard about short attention spans lately when it comes to content. I found that by getting creative with my content, I was able to keep people engaged for longer. I experimented with different types of content, and ultimately prevent them from clicking off the video.

- I try to keep frames changing every 10-20 seconds, wether it's a new camera angle, a new b-roll, or a new piece of information to keep the viewers attention.

- Hook for the end of the video, to keep them watching for longer. Most videos are only watched about 30% 

### 4. Give thanks (Engagement)

Somewhere, I saw Mr. Beast say that early on he would make an effort to respond to every single comment on his videos. I decided to do the same because if people have the time to watch my videos, I should have the time to at least leave a quick thank you.

### 5. Learning from analytics (Data)

I paid attention to my YouTube analytics to understand what was working and what wasn't, and adjusted my content strategy accordingly.

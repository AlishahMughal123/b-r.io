First let me provide you some background on my [YouTube channel](https:/youtube.com/@brianruizy). I uploaded my very first video on November of 2022. What was a simple video that I made for fun, turned into a passion and can even be considered a business. Over the year I experimented with different types of content, and eventually was able to recognize what my audience enjoyed the most.

Some wins and some losses, but in the end a sense of accomplishment. Now I'm confident enought to say that **anyone can start and grow and create a brand or business on YouTube**, by having the right systems in place. Even I was able to and I have been told that I'm shy and introverted. Here are some of the strategies and lessons I learned along the way.

## Find your unfair advantage

>The creator economy is empowering individuals to monetize their skills, passion, and knowledge in ways that were unimaginable before. It's a revolution of opportunity.

When I first started my YouTube channel, I was overwhelmed by the idea of finding a niche. I spent a lot of time trying to figure out what type of content I should create, and what niche I should focus on. However, I soon realized that instead of trying to find a niche, I should focus on finding my unfair advantage.

I started to think about what unique skills, knowledge, or experiences I had that could set me apart from other creators. As a sotware engineer who was **always interested in photography and videos**, I realized that I had a unique perspective to offer. I decided to create content that combined my technical expertise with my passion.

Questions to ask yourself ...

- what are you knowledgeable about?
- what are you passionate about?
- can you entertain, educate, or inspire people in a unique way?
- what unique skills or experiences can you share?

## 5 things I believe helped me grow quickly

<Alert>Note that this is no science, and what has worked for me may not be universal. But I hope that you can take some of these strategies and apply them to your own content creation.</Alert>

### 1. Steal like an artist (ideas)

I spent a lot of time watching other creators and learning from them. I would take note of what worked and what didn't, and then try to apply those lessons to my own content. Inspiration is everywhere, and I found that by paying attention to what other creators were doing, I was able to improve my own content.

### 2. Title and Thumbnail

After getting inspiration and setting on an video idea, I would spend a lot of time on the title and thumbnail. I learned that the title and thumbnail are the first things people see, and if they aren't compelling, people won't click on your video.

### 3. Write it down (Scripting)

At the core of every video I made was a script. I would write down what I wanted to say, and then record myself saying it. This helped me to stay focused and on track, and also made the editing process much easier. I like to use [Notion](https://ntn.so/BrianRuiz2 ) to write my scripts and keep track of my ideas.

### 4. Get Creative / Retention

You've probably heard about short attention spans when it comes to viewing content. I found that by getting creative with my filming, I was able to keep people engaged for longer. I experimented with different types of content, and ultimately prevent them from clicking off the video.

- I try to keep frames changing every 10-20 seconds, wether it's a new camera angle, a new b-roll, or a new piece of information to keep the viewers attention.

- Hook for the end of the video, to keep them watching for longer. Most videos are only watched about 30% 

### 4. Give thanks (Engagement)

Somewhere, I saw Mr. Beast say that early on he would make an effort to respond to every single comment on his videos. I decided to do the same because if people have the time to watch my videos, I should have the time to at least leave a quick thank you.

### 5. Learning from analytics (Data)

I paid attention to my YouTube analytics to understand what was working and what wasn't, and adjusted my content strategy accordingly.

### The Grind

I guess it's fair to say that nothing good comes easy. I spent a lot of time and effort on my YouTube channel, and it wasn't always easy. There were times when I felt like giving up, but I'm glad I didn't. If you're thinking about starting a YouTube channel, be prepared to put in a lot of hours.

Furthermore working full-time and trying to grow a YouTube channel can be very challenging. I had to learn how to manage my time effectively, and I had to make sacrifices in other areas of my life.

### Systems are key

It's very easy to get overwhelmed and lose motivation because you're wearing sooo many hats. Writer, director, editor, marketer, etc. But if you have a system in place, it's easier to stay consistent. Here are some apps I use to manage it all

- Stripe
- Notion
- Final Cut Pro
- Figma

## Ergonomics and Workspace

Optimal ergonomics are crucial for long hours at the desk. I've upgraded to the [Ergonofis Sway Desk](https://ergonofis.com/), offering two preset positions for sitting and standing. It's beautifully designed and features an anti-collision system. The solid wood monitor riser helps reduce eye strain.

## Monitors and Lighting

I use an [LG 34WN780 monitor](https://www.lg.com/) with an Ergo stand that offers complete screen control. On top of the monitor, the [BenQ Screen Bar Halo](https://www.benq.com/) provides even desk illumination.

My workhorse is the [16-inch MacBook Pro](https://www.apple.com/macbook-pro-16/), connected via a [USB-C hub from Anker](https://www.anker.com/). I've found developing on a MacBook to be a great experience. I also use [AirPods Max](https://www.apple.com/airpods-max/) for audio, offering excellent sound quality.

I also have two keycap sets: [GMK Dracula](https://geekhack.org/) and a [Tomorrow-themed set](https://moredesigns.com/). As for my mouse, I use the [Logitech MX Master III](https://www.logitech.com/), known for its extra buttons and great ergonomics.

    Hines is a privately owned global real estate investment, development and
    management firm, founded in 1957, with a presence in 395 cities in 30
    countries and $95.79 billionÂ¹ of investment assets under management and more
    than 96 million square feet of assets for which Hines provides third-party
    property-level services.

    This is a private project, therefore there is no live demo. However the following images and mockups best represent and showcase the work I've done for Hines.

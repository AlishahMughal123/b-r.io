In May 2021, I joined the application development team at Hines â€”one of the largest privately held real estate investors and managers in the world. Our team is responsible for building a suite of applications that help Hines manage its $81.7B Portfolio of Assets Under Management, serving 27 countries worldwide, and doing so successfully for over 64 years.

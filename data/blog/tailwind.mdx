Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that has taken the web development world by storm. It has quickly become a go-to choice for developers who want to streamline their CSS workflow and build websites faster. If you're not already familiar with Tailwind, you may be wondering what all the fuss is about.

In this blog, we'll explore some of the key benefits of using [Tailwind CSS](tailwind.com) as well as some of the drawbacks of more traditional approaches to CSS development. By the end of this post, you'll have a better understanding of how Tailwind can make your development process more efficient and effective, and why it's quickly becoming a must-have tool for web developers of all levels.


## Developer Experience

Working with CSS files that go unused can be a frustrating experience for developers. When a CSS file contains styles that are no longer used in the project, it can make it difficult to find and update the styles that are needed. This can lead to longer development times and <mark>can make maintaining the codebase more difficult</mark> in the long run. Here are a couple key points to consider:


- **Don't spend time thinking of funky names** Tailwind helps you save time and effort by eliminating the need to create unique class names for every element in your UI. You no longer have to struggle to come up with abstract or irrelevant names such as "sidebar-inner-wrapper" or "content-container".

- **reduce the size of your CSS files**, making it easier to manage and maintain. Unlike traditional CSS, where you need to create new stylesheets for every new feature, Tailwind's utility classes can be easily reused throughout your project, significantly reducing the need to write new CSS code.

- **Finally, editing your styles with Tailwind feels safer** because classes are local to the HTML elements. With global CSS, any change you make can have unforeseen consequences elsewhere in your project, but with Tailwind, you can make changes with confidence, knowing that you won't accidentally break anything.

## Reusable Components 

One of the key advantages of Tailwind CSS is its promotion of reusable components. By using pre-defined classes, Tailwind allows developers to create reusable components that can be easily used throughout the codebase. For example, a button component can be created using the bg-blue-500, text-white, and px-4 classes, which can be reused across the project to maintain consistency in design and functionality. 

Here's a quick example of how you can create a reusable card component using Tailwind CSS with some props


### Card Component

In this example, we've used Tailwind's utility classes to create a simple card component that accepts dynamic data through props.

```jsx showLineNumbers {3}
import React from 'react'

const Card = ({ title, description, imageSrc }) => {
  return (
    <div className="max-w-sm rounded overflow-hidden shadow-lg">
        <div className="font-bold text-xl mb-2">{title}</div>
        <p className="text-gray-700 text-base">{description}</p>
    </div>
  )
}

export default Card
```

### Product List Component

We've added two props to our card component: title and description. These props can be passed in from the parent component and used to customize the content of each individual card.

```jsx showLineNumbers {7-11}
import Card from './Card';

const ProductList = ({ products }) => {
  return (
    <template>
      {products.map((product) => (
        <Card 
            key={product.id} 
            title={product.name} 
            description={product.description}
        />
      ))}
    </template>
  );
};
```

So what? This approach not only makes development more efficient but also ensures that the UI is consistent across the project. Additionally, reusable components can be easily updated and maintained, reducing the amount of duplicate code and improving the overall quality of the codebase. Overall, Tailwind's focus on reusable components makes it a valuable tool for any developer looking to create scalable and maintainable user interfaces.

## What About Other UI Libraries?

While there are many UI libraries available, from my experience, I always found myself overriding the default styles of the library to match my project's design language. UI libraries can be a great choice for small projects where you want to quickly create a functional and visually appealing user interface. 

However, at scale, you typically have branding and a company design language that you want to follow or set forth. In these cases, using a UI library may not be the best approach as it can be challenging to customize the styles to fit your branding and design requirements. 

Instead, creating custom components using a utility-first CSS framework like Tailwind can be a better option, as it allows for more flexibility and control over the styling of the components. Overall, while UI libraries can be useful for smaller projects, it's important to consider the specific requirements and constraints of each project before making a decision on which approach to take.

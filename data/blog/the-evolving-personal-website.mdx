My personal website has taken quite a few shapes over the years. With the rise of simple website creators like x or even dribbble portfolios one could ask self; what's a personal website for? Do you even need to build a website yourself? Stating the obvious it's a place to show your portfolio and previous work, showcasing your skills and having contact information.

A personal website can be just that, but it can also be something more. A playground for experimentation, a place to try new techniques, learn new tools, really anything. As Brian Lovin stated in [Incrementally correct personal websites](https://brianlovin.com/overthought/incrementally-correct-personal-websites):

> If you've been struggling with the looming task of redesigning your personal website from scratch, or rebuilding your portfolio after years of neglect, maybe it's time to approach things from a different angle the next time around.

This website is just that. A living place for me to experiment with the latest fun stuff, learn about new techniques and showcase what I do. This is [samuelkraft.com](http://samuelkraft.com) v0.10.
